## Rules

Solutions are to be submitted per email to



Submissions must state the version of the verification system used (for
development versions, internal revision, timestamp, or similar unique
id).
The main rule of the competition is no cheating is allowed. The judges
may penalize or disqualify entrants in case of unfair competition
behavior and may adjust the competition rules to prevent future abuse.
It is allowed to modify the verification system during the competition.
This is to be noted in the solution(s)
All techniques used must be general-purpose, and are expected to extend
usefully to new unseen problems
Internet access is allowed, but using the interget to search for problem
solutions is not.
Involvement of other people beyond those on the team is not allowed.
While care is taken to ensure correctness of the reference
implementations supplied with problem descriptions, the organizers do
not guarantee that they are indeed correct.


(We acknowledge Geoff Sutcliffe for inspiring/suggesting some of these
rules.)
