## Challenge

verifyThis 2014 was held as part of a Dagstuhl seminar on [Evaluating Software Verification Systems:Benchmarks and Competitions](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=14171 "Dagstuhl"). 

#### Challege 1: Conincidence Count

The first challenge was part of a Dafny tutorial: 
Given 2 integer arrays in strictly increasing order, find the number of
values occurring in both sequences (Coincidence Count, A Method of Programming, Dijkstra & Feijen)

#### Challege 2: Bubblesort for Doubly-Linked Lists

This challenge is based on a real bug encountered in the Linux kernel source.
