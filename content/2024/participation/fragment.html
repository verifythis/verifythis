<p><b>Important Dates</b></p>
<p><b>Grant application deadline</b>: March 7th, 2024<br/> (applications considered up to March 15th subject to availability)</p>
<p><b>Competition: </b>April 6th and 7th, 2024</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Participation</b></p>
<p>Participation is open for anybody interested. Teams of up to two people are allowed. VerifyThis will be held as a physical workshop as part of ETAPS 2024 in Luxembourg. Registration for ETAPS workshops and physical presence on site is required. The actual competition will happen on the first day, whereas the second day will be used to discuss and evaluate the solutions. More details and a full program will be announced here on the website.<br/> <br/> We particularly encourage participation of:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>student teams (this includes PhD students)</li> 
 <li>non-developer teams / using a tool someone else developed</li> 
 <li>several teams using the same tool</li> 
</ul>
<h4>Travel Grants</h4>
<p>The competition has funds for a limited number of travel grants. A grant covers the incurred travel and accommodation costs up to a certain limit. The currently-expected limit is EUR 400 for those coming from Europe and EUR 700 for those coming from outside Europe.</p>
<p>We are particularly keen to increase diversity (in all senses) at the competition, and may take this into account if needing to prioritise travel grants; regardless, we strongly encourage you to apply if you have a need.</p>
<p>To apply for a travel grant, send an email to <script type="text/javascript"><![CDATA[eval(unescape('%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%77%72%69%74%65%28%27%3c%61%20%68%72%65%66%3d%5c%22%6d%61%69%6c%74%6f%3a%5c%2f%5c%2f%76%65%72%69%66%79%74%68%69%73%40%67%6f%6f%67%6c%65%67%72%6f%75%70%73%2e%63%6f%6d%5c%22%20%63%6c%61%73%73%3d%5c%22%65%74%68%2d%6c%69%6e%6b%2d%2d%69%63%6f%6e%20%65%74%68%2d%6c%69%6e%6b%2d%2d%69%63%6f%6e%2d%63%61%6c%6c%5f%6d%61%64%65%20%65%74%68%2d%6c%69%6e%6b%5c%22%3e%3c%73%70%61%6e%20%63%6c%61%73%73%3d%5c%22%65%74%68%2d%6c%69%6e%6b%5f%5f%6c%61%62%65%6c%5c%22%3e%65%78%74%65%72%6e%61%6c%20%70%61%67%65%20%3c%5c%2f%73%70%61%6e%3e%76%65%72%69%66%79%74%68%69%73%40%67%6f%6f%67%6c%65%67%72%6f%75%70%73%2e%63%6f%6d%3c%5c%2f%61%3e%27%29'))]]></script> by March 7th, 2024 (or at the latest March 15th).
