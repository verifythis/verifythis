RULES

1.  Solutions are to be submitted per email to
     at the end of the challenge slot.
2.  Submissions must state the version of the verification system used
    (for development versions, internal revision, timestamp, or similar
    unique id).
3.  The main rule of the competition is no cheating is allowed. The
    judges may penalize or disqualify entrants in case of unfair
    competition behavior and may adjust the competition rules to prevent
    future abuse.
4.  It is allowed to modify the verification system during the
    competition. This is to be noted in the solution(s).
5.  All techniques used must be general-purpose, and are expected to
    extend usefully to new unseen problems.
6.  Internet access is allowed, but using the internet to search for
    problem solutions is not.
7.  Involvement of other people beyond those on the team is not allowed.
8.  While care is taken to ensure correctness of the reference
    implementations supplied with problem descriptions, the organizers
    do not guarantee that they are indeed correct.

(We acknowledge Geoff Sutcliffe for inspiring/suggesting some of these
rules.)[[Download ]{.eth-link__label} (PDF, 123
