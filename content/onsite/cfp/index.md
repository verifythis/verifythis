Submit your ingenious problems for VerifyThis 2024!
Deadline: December 15th 2023

To be able to offer a broad and diverse set of verification challenges,
we are collecting submissions of ideas for verification challenges and
problems. We welcome both problems of academic interest as well as
challenges based on themes that are relevant in industry.

The competition proceeds in three rounds. In each round, participants
are given 60 - 120 minutes to implement and prove specified properties
of a given algorithm and/or data structure. They are free to use any
verification tools they choose. Challenges are typically concerned with
proving functional properties of the code in question (at least some
part of a challenge involves expressing and proving properties specific
to the algorithm/data structure in question). It is common for problems
to have multiple parts, e.g. to prove some basic properties first,
perhaps for a simplified case, and to progress to more-advanced goals.

We are currently looking for problem submissions! If you have recently
encountered an interesting challenge in your work where formal
techniques could be applied, please don't hesitate to submit it.
Typical challenges have clear input-output specifications and often
incorporate one or more of the following: heap allocation, concurrency,
arithmetic reasoning. A challenge usually describes a problem using
natural language together with some pseudocode, and then provides a list
of properties or "verification tasks" of varied levels of difficulty.
Contributors are encouraged to look at the Archive of previous
problems.

An award will be given for any submission used in the competition. To
avoid spoiling the competition for others, we ask that you keep the
subject of your submission private. However, note that problem authors
*are* allowed to participate in the competition!

Submissions should be sent by email to **XXX** and **XXX**.

The submission deadline is December 15th, 2023. We look forward to
receiving your ideas!

Submission Criteria:
• A brief yet precise problem description, specifically identifying
verification sub-tasks.
• A solution to the challenge is strongly encouraged, otherwise please
provide a sketch of correctness.
• The description document can use any reasonable format, including
plain text or PDF.

Contributors are encouraged to look at the [Archive of previous
problems](Archive.html "verifyThis Archive").
