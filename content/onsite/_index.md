## About

VerifyThis is a series of program verification competitions, which has
taken place annually since 2011 (with the exception of 2020). Previous
competitions in the series have been held at FoVeOOS 2011, FM 2012,
Dagstuhl (April 2014), and ETAPS 2015---2023. The challenge problems and
solutions of previous competitions are available in the
[archive](/archive.html).

The aims of the competition are:

-   to bring together those interested in formal verification, and to
    provide an engaging, hands-on, and fun opportunity for discussion.
-   to evaluate the usability of program verification techniques and
    tools.

The competition will offer a number of challenges presented in
natural language and pseudo code. Participants have to formalize the
requirements, implement a solution, and formally verify the
implementation for adherence to the specification.

There are no restrictions on the programming language and
verification technology used. The correctness properties posed in
problems will have the input-output behavior of programs in focus.
Solutions will be judged for correctness, completeness, and elegance.

## Related Events and Activities

More-recently, there have also been VerifyThis Long-Term Challenges
designed for informal comparison and collaborations over several months:
see [https://verifythis.github.io/](https://verifythis.github.io/) for details.

Related events also include the Verified Software Competition
(VSComp: [http://sites.google.com/a/vscomp.org/main/](http://sites.google.com/a/vscomp.org/main/), [https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012/compet](https://sites.google.com/site/vstte2012/compet), [http://www.vscomp.org](http://www.vscomp.org/))  held online and the Competition on Software
Verification](http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/)  focusing on evaluating systems in
a way that does not require user interaction. SV-COMP is associated with
TACAS.


VerifyThis is also a collection of verification problems (and
solutions). Its counterpart is [VerifyThus](http://verifythus.cost-ic0701.org/)---a distribution of deductive
verification tools for Java-like languages, bundled and ready to run in
a VM. Both were created with support from [COST Action IC0701](http://verifythus.cost-ic0701.org/).

A workshop on comparative empirical evaluation of reasoning
systems [COMPARE2012](http://compare2012.verifythis.org/) was held on June 30th at IJCAR 2012
in Manchester. Competitions were one of the main topics of the workshop.
