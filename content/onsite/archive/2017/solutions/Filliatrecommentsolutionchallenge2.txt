This is my solution to challenge 2. I verified the single processor solution only. I proved

1. safety
2. sortedness property (first ensures)
3. permutation (second ensures)

I could not complete the proof of termination. I'm using the total number of inversions as the key ingredient for the loop variants, but I still need to prove the "exchange_inversion" lemma. Apart from this lemma, all VCs regarding termination are proved.
