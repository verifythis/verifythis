### Important Dates

**Grant application deadline**: March 7th, 2024 (applications considered up to March 15th subject to availability)

**Competition:** April 6th and 7th, 2024


### Participation

Participation is open for anybody interested. Teams of up to two people
are allowed. VerifyThis will be held as a physical workshop as part of
ETAPS 2024 in Luxembourg.Â Registration for ETAPS workshops and physical
presence on site is required. The actual competition will happen on the
first day, whereas the second day will be used to discuss and evaluate
the solutions. More details and a full program will be announced here on
the website.

We particularly encourage participation of:

-   student teams (this includes PhD students)
-   non-developer teams / using a tool someone else developed
-   several teams using the same tool

### Travel Grants

The competition has funds for a limited number of travel grants. A grant
covers the incurred travel and accommodation costs up to a certain
limit. The currently-expected limit is EUR 400 for those coming from
Europe and EUR 700 for those coming from outside Europe.

We are particularly keen to increase diversity (in all senses) at the
competition, and may take this into account if needing to prioritise
travel grants; regardless, we strongly encourage you to apply if you
have a need.

To apply for a travel grant, send an email **XXX** to **XXX** by March
7th, 2024 (or at the latest March 15th). The application should
include:

-   your name
-   your affiliation
-   the verification system(s) you plan to use at the competition
-   the planned composition of your team (and whether you are developers
    of the tools you\'ll be using)
-   a short letter of motivation explaining your involvement with formal
    verification so far and/or interest in attending the competition
-   if you are a student, please state the academic degree you are
    seeking and have your supervisor send a brief letter of support to
