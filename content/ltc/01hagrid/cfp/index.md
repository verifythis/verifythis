## Introduction

The VerifyThis Long-Term Challenge complements the on-site format of the
VerifyThis competition with a verification challenge, in which teams contribute
to the verification of a practically relevant piece of software over a period of
six months. The challenge aims to be a showcase that deductive program
verification can produce relevant results for real systems with acceptable
effort. The challenge 2020 started in September 2019, and ends February 2020. To
conclude the challenge, we will have a final workshop session at ETAPS along
with the [VerifyThis program verification
competition](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/verifythis.html).





For 2020, the challenge system is the new, implementation of the PGP server
infrastructure, called
[HAGRID](https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2019/06/14/20190614-hagrid/). The old
implementation did not conform to GDPR and was known to be vulnerable against
DoS attacks.

We invite  you to  present your  results on  the verification  of this
security-relevant  challenge system  during a  special session  of the
VerifyThis program verification competition, held at ETAPS.

## Submission

Authors are invited to submit a presentation proposal (or extended
abstract) as a PDF using Springerâ€™s LNCS style, which should be about
a page long, but not longer than three pages (excluding bibliography).
It should discuss ...

* ... the used verification approach and tools
* ... how the challenge was adapted to make verification possible
  (abstractions, reimplementation, different behaviour)
* ... what has been achieved (modelled and verified properties)
* ... successes and challenges encountered in the course of the case
  study.
