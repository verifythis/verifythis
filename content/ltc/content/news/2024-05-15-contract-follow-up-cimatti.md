As a follow-up to the March 2024 [Lorentz Center workshop on Contract
Languages](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/contract-languages.html), we
will host a series of online presentations and discussions around
formal methods with contract languages, aligning with the LTC goal of
enabling information exchange between different formal systems.

The first presentation was given by [Alessandro Cimatti](https://dicenter.fbk.eu/contacts/alessandro-cimatti/) on "Software Contracts meet System Contracts".

The [slides] of this presentation are available.
