I have tried to formalise the natural language requirements into an
Event-B model. It is not necessarily complete, and may not be fully in
line with the natural language description. But it is a starting point
for a discussion.

### Formalisation of the key manager

This Event-B model is an attempt to formalise the requirements of the
VerifyThis Long Term Challenge 2020. It is deliberately kept on a very
high level of abstraction, but should have enough detail to clarify
the behaviour of the system.
