Dear fellows,

We start with the preparation of an online event in which the submitted 
solution are presented and can be discussed. 

The online event is not an replacement of the onsite meeting. 
The onsite event will take place if/when the ETAPS and the 
VerifyThis workshop take place.

Regards, 

Alexander
