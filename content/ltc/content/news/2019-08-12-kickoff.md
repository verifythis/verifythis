At the [KeY Symposium 2019](https://www.key-project.org/key-symposium-2019/) (Manigod, France), the VerifyThis Challenge has been announced.

The [challenge](/challenge/) is currently rudimentary and will be updated soon.

A mailing list is available for participants: verifythis-ltc@lists.kit.edu.

For question, you can directly get in touch with organisers via the Github
issues or email (verifythis-ltc-request@lists.kit.edu).

Good luck.
