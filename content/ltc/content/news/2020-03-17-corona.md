Dear fellows, 

the notification for the presentation are on the way to you. In the meantime, 
the ETAPS is postponed due to the COVID-19 spread.

Our information are currently limited to the official information on the 
ETAPS front-page: <https://www.etaps.org/>. But we stick to the plan of having 
an on-site event with the VerifyThis workshop. 


Please stayed tuned in. When more information is available, 
we let you know on this web page and via the mailing-list 
<verifythis-ltc@lists.kit.edu> (<https://www.lists.kit.edu/sympa/info/verifythis-ltc>). 

Regards, 

Alexander
