title: The PGP Key Server
---

The *VerifyThis verification competition* is a regular event run as an
onsite meeting with workshop character in which three challenges are
proposed that participants have to verify in 90 minutes each using
their favourite program verification tool.

We have experienced that the state of the art of program verification
allows the participants to specify and verify impressively complex
algorithms in this short a time span. If such sophisticated, realistic
but not real, problems can be solved in real-time, what would be
achievable if (a)~we as the program verification community
collaborated and (b) the time constraints were removed?

The *VerifyThis Collaborative Long Term Challenge* aims at proving that
deductive program verification can produce relevant results for real systems
with acceptable effort. This challenge is not competitive. It would be nice if
one group could prove the protocol of the system to be correct whereas another
group would show that an implementation follows that protocol, and is hence
correct. Participants have time from mid August 2019 until end of February 2020
to choose aspects and parts of the challenge system that they try to specify and
verify with the tool of their choice.

## The OpenPGP Key Server

When using public key encryption and signatures in e-mails, one challenge is to
obtain the public key of recipients. To this end, public key servers have been
installed that can be queried for public keys. The most popular [^1] public key
server OpenPGP was recently shown to have severe security flaws. There was not
protection on who could publish a key for an e-mail address and no protection on
the amount of data published. This opened the gate for attacks: An attacker
could publish a large number of large keys for the identity of the attacked.
This led to two results: People, who want to send an e-mail to the target, might
choose an untrusted key that does not belong to the target, but someone
completely different.[^2] They would also not be able to pick the right key
entry from the key server amongst the many fake ones. And more critically,
clients (like the GPG) of the service, have struggle to handle these large
*spam* keys---resulting into
[CVE-2019-13050](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4264021). More background
information *denial-of-service* attack are available in the [blog post of the
developers](https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2019/06/14/20190614-hagrid/). Moreover,
the old key server software SKS did not conform to the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and had performance issues.

As a consequence, the OpenPGP community decided to implement a new server
framework that manages the access to public keys. The new official server is
called [HAGRID](https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid), it is a open
source, and it is already in [production](https://keys.openpgp.org). The project
is written in the programming language Rust and comprises some 6,000 lines of
code in total [^3]. This implementation is the reference implementation of the
server.

The server is essentially a database that allows users to store their public key
for their e-mail address, to query for keys for e-mail addresses and to
tracelessly remove e-mail-key pairs from the database. To avoid illegal database
entry and removal actions, confirmations are sent out to the e-mail addresses of
issuing users upon an addition or removal request.

The server possesses a web frontend which accepts requests from users or via
API. It additionally possesses a connection to a database from which it reads
key-value pairs and writes to it. And an e-mail connection.

At the core of the server there are n operations that can be triggered
from outside via the web front end. These are

* **Request adding a key** A user can issue a request for storing a key for
  a particular e-mail address. To avoid that anybody can store a key for someone
  else's e-mail address, the key is not directly stored into the database, but
  a confirmation code is returned which is then sent by e-mail to the specified
  address. Only once the confirmation code is activated, will the address be
  actually added to the database.

* **Querying an e-mail address** Any user can issue a request for learning the
  key(s) stored with a concrete e-mail address. Unlike on the old public server,
  queries for patterns are not allowed on the HAGRID server. Public keys that
  have been removed or have not yet been confirmed must not be returned in
  queries.

* **Request removing a key** The user can request the removal of the association
  between a key and an e-mail address. The process begins with the confirmation
  via the e-mail address: The user enters one of their previously confirmed
  addresses. The server sends an e-mail to this address containing a link.
  Behind this link, there then a website that allows the removal of the key's
  association.

* *Confirming a request* Additions and removals are indirect actions. Instead of
  modifying the database directly, they issue a (secret and random) confirmation
  code. Confirmation of a code is performed using this operation. If the
  provided code is one recently issued then the corresponding operation
  (addition/removal) is finalised.

## Challenges

The challenge is to prove such a real/realistic key server application correct.
This may be done by analysing the Rust reference implementation or by
abstracting from it towards a transition system or by re-implementing the
requirements of the key server in your own implementation.

Instead of verifying the reference implementation, any implementation that
satisfies the requirements can be considered for verification. An implementation
may also make use of underlying (provenly or assumedly correct)
libraries/middleware for the database or e-mail handling or web server
management. On the other hand, if you are up to a larger challenge, go ahead and
verify the web server front end and the database back end, too!

This challenge proposes a number of concrete verification tasks that allow
participants to shape their verification effort. However, there are certainly
other interesting properties not mentioned in this document which could be
analysed. Any participant should feel free to add to the long term challenge by
contributing additional questions and possibly answers for them.

{: .challenge}
**Identify relevant properties.**
Identify properties of the key server that are worth being formally
analysed. Formalise the properties in a formalism of your choice and
verify them using the tool of your choice.

If you like, discuss the relevance of the properties (e.g.,
security, safety, performance, ...).

In the following, this document describes a number of basic verification
challenges for *Collaborative Long Term Challenge*. You are invited to
tackle them or define your own goals.

The first challenge is the least specific task and allows almost many formal
system to participate. Verification tools that run fully automatically (like the
participants in the VSCOMP[^4] competitions) are particularly invited to
contribute solutions to this challenge and to show that this can be done without
further user input. For this foundational verification question, no formal
(full) specification is required.

{: .challenge}
**Safety.**
Verify that the implementation of the key server does not exhibit undesired
runtime effects (no runtime exceptions in Java, no undefined behaviour in C,
...)

Traditionally, the challenges in VerifyThis are more heavy weight, and usually
go beyond pure safety conditions and strive to establish properties that require
a logical formalisation that needs to be verified. In many cases, some form of
guidance (on top of the specification) for the verification is required.

To this end, this document features a natural language description of
the requirements of the five core operations.
They are to be taken into consideration for the next challenge and
must be made accessible for formal verification.
%
We assume that every operation

{: .challenge}
**Functionality.**
Formalise the natural language specifications for the five core operations.
Prove that the implementation of the operations satisfy your
formalisation.

One example functionality property is that if an e-mail address is queried, the
key stored for this e-mail address is returned if there is one. This challenge
is classical functional verification -- and thus corresponds to the onsite
challenges of the VerifyThis competition. Feel free to make to your
specification as strong as sensible. You are invited to add to your contribution
a discussion of why this formal specification captures the informal properties
correctly.

There are properties that cannot be formalised as functional properties. One
example of these are privacy properties. The long term challenge shall not be
bound to stop at function properties, but can go beyond if tools support it:

{: .challenge}
**Privacy.**
Specify and prove that the key server adheres to privacy
principles. In particular: (a) Only exact query match results are
ever returned to the user issuing a query. (b) Deleted information
cannot be retrieved anymore from the server.

One example of such a property is that if an e-mail address has been
deleted from the system, no information about the e-mail address is
kept in the server.

Another field of interesting properties (that also have been addressed
in VerifyThis recently) are questions around concurrency. They are
centered around the actual implementation. One interesting property
amongst the ones dealing with concurrency is

{: .challenge}
**Thread safety.**
Specify and verify that the implementation under consideration is
free of data races.


Let us close this section by listing a few more challenges that might inspire
you when thinking about the challenges that you will tackle with the system.

**Termination.**
Prove that any operation of the server terminates.

**Randomness.**
Prove that any created confirmation code is<br>
 a. randomly chosen (i.e. that every string from the range is equally likely),<br>
 b. cannot easily be predicted,<br>
 c. is never leaked, but as the return value of the issuing operation.
