Dear all,

A Dagstuhl meeting on Principles of Contract Languages had been

because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Last April a number of groups participated in the online event for the
Verify This Long Term Challenge 2020. As a follow-up on this, we would
like to seize the opportunity to use the challenge and the available
solutions to stipulate a discussion on the features that an ideal
specification language would possess for this purpose.
We will use the recent Verify This Long Term Challenge as a show case.

**Friday, 27th November 2020 10:00 - 12:00 UTC**

We hope to talk to you all on November 27!

Mattias, Ra√∫l, Alexander and Marieke
