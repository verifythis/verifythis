[Information for participating are below.](#participating)

**Backgrund:** The [VerifyThis Collaborative Large Scale Challenge](/)
aims at proving that deductive program verification can produce
relevant results for real systems with acceptable effort. We initially
looked [HAGRID](https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid) as a case
study, but have since moved on to considering [a simple Solidity
casino](/02casino) as the running example.

**Agenda:** We will continue and deepen this discussion by trying to
identify how different approaches can exchange informations. We will
have two talks:

- Jonas Schiffl on TLA translations for Smart Contracts, 
- Mattias Ulbrich on his concept of Co-Contracts.
