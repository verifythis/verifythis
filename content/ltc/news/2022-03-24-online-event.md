**Backgrund:** The [VerifyThis Collaborative Large Scale Challenge](/)
aims at proving that deductive program verification can produce
relevant results for real systems with acceptable effort. We initially
looked [HAGRID](https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid) as a case
study, but have since moved on to considering [a simple Solidity
casino](/02casino) as the running example.

**Agenda:** We will continue and deepen this discussion by trying to
identify how different approaches can exchange informations.  We will
compare artifacts and specififications and will see what each approach
could provide and where it could benefit from other tools.

To this end, we have collected the solutions presented last time as in
a [fact sheet gallery](/02casino/factsheets) quickly summarising
the approaches and provided models/implementations.

It will be the goal of the time until the meeting and of the meeting
itself to fill the items in "Can offer" and "Look for".

We present some ideas on how contracts can be used to communicate
between different verification approaches.
