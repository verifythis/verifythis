[Information for participating are below.](#participating)

A final workshop session for the challenge had been planned at ETAPS
(along with the [VerifyThis program verification
competition](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/verifythis.html)).
Since ETAPS has been postponed, we will meet and exchange online. We
have received several submissions that each contribute a solution to
different aspects of the challenge using different abstractions,
different assumptions and different verification techniques. During this
online meeting, the different solutions will be briefly explained, and
we discuss the approaches, how they can benefit from one another and how
further verification success can be stipulated.
