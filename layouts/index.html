      <h2><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> What is VerifyThis?</h2>
      <p>
        The VerifyThis verification competition is a regular event run
        as an onsite meeting with workshop character in which three
        challenges are proposed that participants have to verify in 90
        minutes each using their favourite program verification tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have experienced that the state of the art of program
        verification allows the participants to specify and verify
        impressively complex algorithms in this short a time span. If
        such sophisticated, realistic but not real, problems can be
        solved in real-time, what would be achievable if (a) we as the
        program verification community collaborated and (b) the time
        constraints were removed?

      <h2><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> The Memcached Challenge</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>VerifyThis Long-Term Challenge</strong> aims at
        proving that deductive program verification can produce
        relevant results for real systems with acceptable effort on
        a large scale in a collaborative manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current challenge is dedicated <a href="/03memcached">memcached</a>,
        a simple LRU-cache based key-value server. Memcached is the backbone for fast
        response times in distributed web-application. The goal is not
        only to provide an investigation on the server alone, but also
        take the client-side and the protocol into our considerations.

      <h2><i class="fas fa-user-friends"></i> How to participate?</h2>
      <p>
        Participation on the challenge is easy. You should pick your favourite
        tool for the formal software assessment, and try whether you
        find a bug or prove adhering of the specification in HAGRID (or
        a suitable abstraction).
        Of course you can participate in groups. Moreover, we would like to foster
        collaboration between participating groups. Therefor we would
        appreciate if you <a href="/registration/">register your group</a>.

	Do not forget to also subscribe to our
	<a href="https://www.lists.kit.edu/sympa/info/verifythis-ltc"> mailing list </a>
	(verifythis-ltc@lists.kit.edu) to be able to share your questions and
	your work and to keep up to date with the work of the rest of the teams.

        We plan to go for a Track on ISoLA 2024. In the intermediate,
        we plan rather informal meetings on iFM'23 and ETAPS'24.
