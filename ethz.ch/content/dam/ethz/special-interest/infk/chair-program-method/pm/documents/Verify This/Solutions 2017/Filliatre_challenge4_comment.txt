This is my solution to challenge 4. It contains a default implementation, the Caterpillar implementation, and the RealTime implementation.

Regarding the latter, however, it makes little sense to implement it in Why3, which assumes a garbage collector. I tried to stay close to the
C++ code. There are slightly more comments in this solution than in the
previous ones.
