hi,

here is the solution of jonas schiffl and michael kirsten. We think we fully specified the algorithm but got stopped by a bug in KeY.
We measured the "sortedness" by the the two integers unsortedEven and unsortedOdd.
We also verified the swap method (and our used model methods), but symbolic execution of the model methods was stopped by a bug (exception in KeY system).

best regards,
Michael
